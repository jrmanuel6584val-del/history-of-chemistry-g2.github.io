                    <h3>Ancient Mesopotamian and Babylonian Chemistry</h3>
                    <p>n the early days of the Mesopotamian region, a city-state named Babylon was created. This city-state conquered most of Mesopotamia (the region it was in), and the resulting stability brung forth the first traces of chemistry in the world. [1] Practices like metallurgy (metal and copper-working), glassblowing (for bottles & lamps), textile weaving (to make fabrics), flood control, and water storage and irrigation (three concepts that go hand in hand) were first done. The creation of alloys was also found; bronze, an alloy of copper, tin, and arsenic was used as decorations, armor metal, and weapons. In the wider Mesopotamia, the Archimedes' screw, the earliest hydraulic machine, was speculated to be used by a king of Assyria in the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. [2] Sadly, this came to a halt, as the 11th century BCE came to a close. Thus starts the Ancient Chinese age.

                    <h3>Ancient Chinese Chemistry</h3>
                    <p>China has a vast history. [3] From the communist country it is today from the monarchy that ended after World War I, from the Mongol Yuan dynasty to the first Chinese state unified by Qin Shi Huang, it has been through a lot. The first footprints of civilization can be seen in the Xia dynasty, a kingdom that ruled for 4 centuries, to the Shang dynasty that existed for 6 centuries, and the Zhou dynasty that lasted the longest in Chinese history, being 8 centuries old. After this last dynasty, the Chinese kingdom fell apart into a tight-knit group of warring states. The Qijia culture of Qinghai, Gansu, and western Shaanxi were the first people to use copper as an all-rounder metal, using it for utilitarian items and more. [4] Bronze was used in the early 2000s BCE. It was used to cast in a mold, lost-wax casting, and more. Iron was used for nearly a millennium, from 1000 BCE to 200 BCE. Alchemy has been done here, too, in the form that suits the local culture. In this practice, the body is the center of the five agents of change, or Wuxing, that observation and cultivation of which would lead the person to align and get harmony with the Tao. Realgar was used, in natural medicine, as a disinfectant to treat acne [5], and silver paste (a mixture of mercury, silver, and tin) was used to fill in cavities and holes in mouths. In 200 CE, paper was invented by Cai Lun, a eunuch official of the Eastern Han dynasty. [6] Eight centuries later, in 1000 CE, the formula for gunpowder was written down on paper. The Chinese people are clever and can go on with the times, but sadly, they fell over when the Mongol Empire [7] took over. A new civilization to the west has formed, let's take a look at it.

                    <h3> Ancient Greek and Roman Chemistry</h3>
                    <p>Greece is a state in the east Mediterranean. In ancient times, it was a hotspot of trade, agriculture and life. The first people in the peninsula, the Mycenaeans, collapsed after the Dark Ages of Greece. [8] After a few centuries, a newer population led to city-states being formed—urban centers inseparable from their local territory. These city-states fostered sophisticated politics, marble temples, drama and philosophy. It also was a sprouting seed for chemistry, planting new ideas to grow into the advanced world we have today. Firstly, elemental substances were defined: earth, fire, air and water. The first traces of atoms could be seen here, too, as shown by the work of the Greek philosopher Democritus. Earlier than Democritus, Leucippus declared that atoms were indivisible. Aristotle opposed the existence of atoms. Polybus, the physician, argued that the human body was instead made up of four humors. Epicurus then postulated that there was a universe of indestructible atoms in which we were responsible for achieving a balanced life. [9] Due to a loss in the Peloponnesian Wars, city-states became less favored and Greece was crushed under Macedonian expansion in the late 4th century BC. Because of this, Greek culture spread far across the world, reaching the farthest shores of the Indus River. This locked the fate of the Greek people, who after invasion by the Macedons, were then invaded by the Romans. The Romans used to be a city-state centered on Central Italy named Rome, that, according to legend, was founded by two brothers, Romulus and Remus. Then, two centuries later, the Roman Republic was formed, with two leaders at its helm; one of its leaders, Julius Caesar, formed the basis for the Roman Empire. Over the next few centuries, the Roman Empire took over the entirety of the Mediterranean Sea. [10] The spread of the Roman Empire caused peace that then formed the basis for its chemistry. To explain Epicurean philosophy to the masses, the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius wrote De rurum natura (On the Nature of Things) in the 1st century BC. In this work, Lucretius explains the principles of atomism, the nature of the mind and soul, explanations of sensation and thought, the development of the world and its phenomena, and explains a variety of celestial and terrestrial happenings. [11] The Romans were far-reaching, from Spain in the west to Mesopotamia in the east. It also encompassed Egypt in its largest, taking over all of Northern Africa. Let's take a look at Ancient Egyptian chemistry next.

                    <h3>Ancient Egyptian Chemistry (Alchemy)</h3>
                    <p>The Romans conquered any land they could to expand their empire. Among these territories, regions like Spain, France and Germany would flourish many centuries from then. Some regions also have had history before the Romans came in, like Mesopotamia, Greece, and Egypt. Ancient Egypt was not the desert we know today, instead centered around the Nile River in a kingdom stretching from Alexandria (a city in northern Egypt) in the north to Nubia (today's Sudan) in the south. [12] The surrounding areas from this region also helped them immensely; the Semitic Amorites, the founders of the city-state Babylon, originated from here. Thus, they took knowledge from their west, Mesopotamia. They took from them metallurgy, glass-making, textile weaving, and more. Although that's not the only thing Egyptians did! Egyptians made art using tints and made colorful cosmetics for the king and queen. The most well-known contribution of Ancient Egypt was the papyrus, a proto-paper used to carry information down towards the rivers. [13] They mixed up soot with vegetable gum to make a crude ink, and substituted soot for other organic material to make different colors, like red ochre that makes red ink. The Egyptians also had a proto-chemistry, alchemy. The word comes from the Greek term for Egypt (Khēmeía, the Black Land), then the Arabs borrowed it and added their equivalent of the word the (al-). The reach of alchemy spans more countries, like India or China in the east, and in their future, the Medieval Ages of Europe. But first of all, what is alchemy?
</p>
                    <h3>Alchemy</h3>
                    <p>This is an ancient branch of natural philosophy, first found in Greco-Roman Egyptian texts. [14] This act aims to purify, mature, and perfect metals, for example, turning base metals (e.g. lead) into noble metals (e.g. and most commonly, gold). This act also intends to create an "elixir of immortality" and to create a panacea (a cure for all diseases). This practice can be traced back from later in Egypt's history, after the pyramids were built; 1st century AD, after Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia, conquered Egypt and left an heir to rule them. This Hellenistic period in Egypt's history also marks Alexandria turning into a center for alchemical knowledge, and it remained after the Greeks and the Romans took hold. Early texts by Mary the Jewess [15], Pseudo-Democritus [16], and Agathodaemon, known authors of alchemical texts, detail the history of alchemy. From Zosimos of Panopolis, the author that helped locate the three others, it has been found that alchemy traces its roots back from Egyptian and Mesopotamian metallurgy and ceremonial practices. There was a veil of mythology on alchemy, revolving around Hermes Trismegistus, from the name of Thoth and his counterpart in Greece, Hermes. The caduceus or serpent-staff was one of the most well-known symbols of alchemy, and it shows since the caduceus is also the modern symbol for medicine. [17]
</p>
                    <p>Egypt has a lot of influences, and so does chemistry as a whole. But when did chemistry stop being ancient and start being modern? Let's find out.

                <div class="period-section">
                    <h3>Transition between Ancient and Modern: Medieval Alchemy</h3>
                    <p>Alchemy stuck around after the Romans were dead and gone. Ideas of it were spread through Arabia and the Middle East and were rooted in the classical elements of Greek tradition (earth, fire, air, water). [18] Jābir ibn Hayyān, an Arab philosopher, added two elements to the four classical ones: sulfur and mercury; sulfur being the principle of combustibility, and mercury being the principle of metallic properties. [19] These two added elements were seen as representations of irreducible elements of the universe, and thus were of higher consideration. This led to a Swiss alchemist, Paracelsus, relating the three metallic principles to the description of wood burning: smoke described volatility (mercury), the flames symbolized flammability (sulfur), and a new third addition (salt) being symbolized by the ash remaining after the wood burns, being solid. [20] This period of alchemy is defined by the quest to get the philosopher's stone (a substance that could turn base metals into gold or silver), thus they were pushing themselves to transform on an esoteric (spiritual) and exoteric (physical) way. [21] During the Renaissance, when science won over religion, physical or exoteric alchemy remained popular as Paracelsian iatrochemistry, while spiritual or esoteric alchemy flourished, returning back to its roots in Platonic, Hermetic and Gnostic ways of believing. [22] Before the advent of modern chemistry, many alchemists contributed to the shared study of science, like Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton.

                        <li>An English chemist, physicist, and meteorologist.</li>
                        <li>Formulated the atomic theory [31] and proposed the Law of Multiple Proportions [32].</li>
                        <p><strong>Law of Multiple Proportions</strong></p>
                        <p>-If two elements form more than one compound, the ratio of masses of the second element that combine with the fixed mass of the first element must be a small, whole-number ratio. For example, to form carbon dioxide, there must be 16 grams of carbon and 32 grams of oxygen to create a stable bond (1:2).</p>
                        <p><strong>Dalton’s Atomic Theory</strong></p>
                        <p>-All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms, which make up everything, including our bodies. The atoms of a given element are always identical, while the atoms of different elements differ; for example, atoms of gold can combine with each other, but if a gold atom meets a silver atom, they remain separate. Compounds are formed when atoms combine in small whole-number ratios, as described by the Law of Multiple Proportions. Chemical reactions, on the other hand, involve only the reorganization of atoms, meaning the atoms themselves do not change—for instance, when rust forms on metal, the atoms within the rust are still metal atoms.</p>

                    <h4>Joseph Louis Proust (1754-1826)</h4>
                    <p>A French chemist, John Louis Proust, is known for formulating the Law of Definite Proportions. At the end of the 18th century, through experiments on chemical reactions, he observed that most substances are composed of two or more elements. This idea was soon accepted by most scientists of the time. He also discovered that compounds always contain the same percentage of elements, regardless of their source or who prepared them, which led to the formulation of the Law of Definite Composition.</p>

                        <li><strong>Law of Definite Composition</strong> -  Compounds contain the same element in definite proportion and in no other combination. [33] (e.g. carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide, you cannot slide another atom of an element in there)

                    <p><strong>"Discoverer of X-rays"</strong></p>
                    <p>A German teacher, professor, and physicist, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, is credited with the discovery of the X-ray in 1895, paving the way for the immediate development of X-ray radiography. \[34] While experimenting with tubes, he noticed a fluorescent effect when a screen coated with barium platinocyanide was placed near a cathode ray tube with a thin aluminum window. Curious about the phenomenon, he tested it using a much thicker Crookes-Hittorf tube, which he covered with black cardboard. Using a Ruhmkorff coil—now called an induction coil—he connected it to the tube to produce an electrostatic charge. Before placing the barium platinocyanide screen again, he darkened the entire room and observed that the coated screen faintly glowed from several feet away from the tube. This crucial observation led to his discovery of the X-ray.

                    <h4>Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852-1908) & Marie Curie (1867-1934)</h4>
                    <p><strong>"Pioneers of Radioactivity"</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Becquerel:</strong></p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                        <p>In 1896, Henri Becquerel, a French physicist, made the first discovery of radioactivity. Inspired by Wilhelm Röntgen’s discovery of X-rays, he set out to investigate whether uranium emitted similar rays. He placed a coin on top of a photographic plate, wrapped it in black paper, and then placed uranium salts above it. After leaving it in a sealed cabinet for several days, he developed the plate and found that the uranium itself emitted energy strong enough to cast an image, even without sunlight. This proved that uranium gave off its own type of invisible radiation, independent of external energy sources. Becquerel’s work was the first to uncover the natural phenomenon of radioactivity.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Marie and Pierre Curie:</strong></p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                        <p>Fascinated by Becquerel’s discovery, Marie and Pierre Curie continued the research between 1897 and 1903. Using an electrometer built by Pierre and his brother, Marie observed that uranium emitted radiation which allowed air around it to conduct electricity. She proposed that this radiation came not from molecular interactions but directly from the atom itself—an idea that revolutionized atomic theory.
Despite interruptions after the birth of their daughter Irène, Marie worked persistently, even in a makeshift shed laboratory. In 1898, she and Pierre discovered two new radioactive elements: polonium, named after Marie’s homeland Poland, and radium, from the Latin word for “ray.” Polonium was relatively easy to identify due to its similarity to bismuth, but radium was extremely difficult to isolate because of its resemblance to barium, requiring complex crystallization techniques.
By the early 1900s, the Curies had expanded on Becquerel’s work, proving that radioactivity was a fundamental property of certain elements. In recognition of their groundbreaking discoveries, Henri Becquerel, Marie Curie, and Pierre Curie were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.</p>
